# C# Riot API Library

This is a simple C# Class Library which contains a Method for every Riot API End Point.

To make a Request using it. Simply import it into your application it, or install the Nuger Package.

- Once that is done, you can make requests by calling the class like so "RiotAPI.~" This will then bring up a List of Methods, simply find the one you wish to make a Request too and fill out the parameters with your data.
- The response will be a string, which you can easily parse into a JObject or JArray using Newtonsoft.JSON and then read with ease.
